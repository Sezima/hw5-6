          territory of the country was geographically isolated by high
          mountains, that helped to keep its ancient culture of nomads.
          Scythians (Scyth, Saka) were the first inhabitants of the modern
          territory of Kyrgyzstan. At the middle of IX century on the ruins of
          Uyghur Khaganate, there was upraise of Kyrgyz tribes, joined into
          Kyrgyz Khaganate, strong and rich Khanate with big territory from
          Guligani (Baikal) till Tibet, whole territory of Gelolu (Seven rivers)

          with Ajo at the head (Kagan or Khan) with 20 Beks (Ministers) and 15
          clerks for clerical work, taxes, finance and law. By the end of Kyrgyz
          Khaganate, era of Turkic domination at Eurasia changed by domination
          of Mongol tribes. Kyrgyz tribes were overrun by Mongols, Qing Dynasty
          and Kokand Khanate. At the end of 19th century Russian Empire came to
          Kyrgyz land. At 1936 was established Kyrgyz Soviet Socialistic

          million people spoke Kyrgyz and 2,5 million spoke Russian. Religion
          Islam is a dominant religion of the Kyrgyzstan – about 80% –
          non-denominational Muslims, 17% followers of Russian Orthodoxy, 3%
          other religions. During the Soviet time the strong believe in atheism
          was greeted. Strong believe of nomads – Tengrizm- characterised by
          shamanism, totemism and ancestors worship was popular among the
          people. Tengri – is an eternal blue sky, heaven and holy spirit of the
